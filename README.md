# Google-Calendar-Scheduler
A script I made after learning Python for about 6 months. It used to login to my work website, scrape my schedule, add it to Google calendar, and then send me a text when it was ready. It would then repeat these steps for my wife's schedule.

# Notes
Keep in mind that I wrote this code during the summer of 2018 after studying and working with Python for about 6 months (off and on mostly, and then very intensely for about a month). With that, there is going to be a good bit of code that is probably inefficient: I know. Please refrain from pointing out "Oh, you could do this a better way!", again, I know. I haven't touched that script in a long time since I have a salaried job and there's no point in scripting that lol.

That being said, if you all have any questions or are curious as to why something is in there, feel free to ask however you like and I'll do my best to get back to you.

Have fun!
